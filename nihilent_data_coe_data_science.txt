Bots
Chatbots are quickly becoming a normal communication avenue for businesses around the world. With that said, there are many other bot deployments that are also worth looking into to interact naturally with your users where they are wanting to connect (i.e. website, apps, social media, and more). Nihilent can help you build, connect, deploy and manage your intelligent bots to help you succeed.

Not only can bots excel at natural conversations, but they can also leverage other cognitive services such as recognizing photos, moderate content, making intelligent recommendations, translating language, and much more. Enable your bot to see, hear, and interpret in more human ways to improve your customer experience.

Intelligent bots can help hasten customer service, digital commerce, contact centers, and more. For instance, bots can be leveraged for:

Increase sales across digital channels.
Lower costs of customer service and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Increase employee productivity and satisfaction by automating high-frequency and routine service desk interactions.
Cognitive Services
Technology is best served when you don’t even know it’s there. Evolving your apps, websites or both to leverage cognitive services, enables them to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret your user’s needs through natural methods of communication.

Cognitive Services
Machine Learning
Machine Learning enables computers to augment human capabilities by learning from data and experience to act without being explicitly programmed, therefore helping organizations achieve more. Machine Learning provides intelligence by learning from data, identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human involvement.

Many organizations are collecting large amounts of data that they don’t know what to do with. By leveraging Machine Learning, organizations can quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze large, complex data to deliver faster and more accurate results gaining an advantage over competitors.
